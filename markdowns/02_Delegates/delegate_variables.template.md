# Background: Delegate Variables

### Delegate expressions
The `FuncTwoInts` type can be used to declare variables like this:

```csharp
//// EMBED: LinqCourseEmbeddedCode/Delegates1.cs, Delegate expressions 1
```

Or like this:

```csharp
//// EMBED: LinqCourseEmbeddedCode/Delegates1.cs, Delegate expressions 2
```

Or this:

```csharp
//// EMBED: LinqCourseEmbeddedCode/Delegates1.cs, Delegate expressions 3
```

Or even like this:

```csharp
//// EMBED: LinqCourseEmbeddedCode/Delegates1.cs, Delegate expressions 4
```

### Lambda expressions
The last two delegate examples above (the ones utilizing the => operator) are called lambda expressions. Lambda expressions are just a more efficient way of defining a delegate.

> **NOTE:** The => operator is called the lambda operator.
