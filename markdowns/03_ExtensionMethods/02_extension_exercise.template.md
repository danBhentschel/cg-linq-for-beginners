# Exercise: Extension Methods

In the previous lesson, we learned how to write extension methods to enhance existing types.

In this exercise, you must add an extension method, `SayHello()` to the built-in `string` type. The `SayHello()` method should return the string: "Hello, &lt;subject&gt;!"

For reference, here is the example extension method from the previous page:

```csharp
//// EMBED: LinqCourseEmbeddedCode/CoolExtensionsForInt.cs, Example extension method declaration
```
