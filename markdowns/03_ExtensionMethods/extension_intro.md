# Background: Extension Methods

Extension methods in C# allow the addition of new methods to a pre-existing type, without modifying the original source code for that type. This can be very useful for adding functionality to classes or interfaces found in a third-party library, or even in the .NET Framework libraries.

### Why learn about extension methods?
All LINQ methods are extension methods, defined in the `System.Linq` namespace.

### Example extension method

Here is what an extension method declaration looks like:
```csharp
namespace IntExtensions
{
    public static class CoolExtensionsForInt
    {
        public static string Growl(this int num)
        {
            return $"G{new string('r', num)}";
        }
    }
}
```

The name of the class isn't important, nor is the name of the method. The important elements are:
 - The class and method must both be `static`
 - The first parameter to the method must be of the type that is being extended
 - The first parameter to the method must be prefaced with the keyword `this`

### Calling an extension method

The above extension method can be called as if it were a member of the `int` type. For example:

```csharp
using IntExtensions;

  ...

    // Prints "Grrrrrrr" to the console
    Console.WriteLine(7.Growl());
```

Notice that, since the extension method is defined in the `IntExtensions` namespace, that namespace must be included with a `using` directive.
