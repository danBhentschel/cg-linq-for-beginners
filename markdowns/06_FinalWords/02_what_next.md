## Reinforcing
Here are some other resources you can use to reinforce the information covered in this course.

### Delegates (Microsoft C# Programming Guide)
There is an informative section on [delegates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/delegates/) in the C# Programming Guide.

### C# Events, Delegates and Lambdas (Pluralsight)
Pluralsight is an excellent online training site. It offers a large number of .NET courses on a wide variety of topics, presented by very knowledgeable developers. Pluralsight is a paid resource, but it is well worth the money if you are serious about learning .NET.

The [C# Events, Delegates and Lambdas](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-events-delegates/table-of-contents) course, by Dan Wahlin, gives much more detail on delegates, this time from the perspective of events and event handlers.

### Extension methods (Microsoft C# Programming Guide)
The C# Programming guide has a nice, short article on [extension methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods).

### C# Programming Paradigms (Pluralsight)
The [C# Programming Paradigms](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-fundamentals-2/table-of-contents) Pluralsight course, by Scott Allen, gives some good information about delegates and extension methods in the first chapter, entitled _C# and LINQ_.

### Iterators (Microsoft C# Programming Guide)
There is also a small section on [iterators](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dscyy5s0.aspx) in the C# Programming Guide.

### Iterator Pattern and Sequences (Pluralsight)
The [Tactical Design Patterns in .NET: Control Flow](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/tactical-design-patterns-dot-net-control-flow/table-of-contents) course on Pluralsight, by Zoran Horvat, has a section on the _Iterator Pattern and Sequences_ that gives more information about sequences, and shows an example of how to build a class that implements `IEnumerable<T>`.

## Expansion
Here are some resources to expand your knowledge of C#. They build on the information introduced in the course you have just completed.

### Using C# LINQ - A Practical Overview

[Using C# LINQ - A Practical Overview](https://tech.io/playgrounds/213), another tech.io course, is designed to build on the information contained in the course you have just completed. It explains the functionality and usage of over 25 different LINQ methods.

### C# Extension Methods (Pluralsight)
The [C# Extension Methods](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-extension-methods/table-of-contents) Pluralsight course, by Elton Stoneman, gives a deep dive into extension methods, with some very insightful discussion of their uses and limitations.

### LINQ Architecture (Pluralsight)

[LINQ Architecture](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/linq-architecture/table-of-contents) is another Pluralsight course by Scott Allen. It is a quick watch, and provides a lot of good ideas for what can be done in C# with the concepts introduced with LINQ.
