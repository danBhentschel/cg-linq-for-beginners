# C# LINQ Background Topics
Welcome to **C# LINQ Background Topics**. This course is designed as an in-depth study of topics to provide context for the **Using C# LINQ** course.

The lesson plan covers delegates, generators, and extension methods, with specific focus on how these language features apply to LINQ.

### Related Courses
This course is designed be taken in conjunction with the **Using C# LINQ - A Practical Overview** (Link TBD) course, though it can stand on its own as well. You can read through this **Background Topics** course either before or after taking the **Using C# LINQ** course.

There is also another companion course,**C# LINQ Advanced Topics** (Link TBD) that is only recommended for advanced users who have completed both the **Using C# LINQ** course and this **Background Topics** course.

> This is pretty advanced material. Don't get discouraged. Familiarity with the concepts in this course will give you a fuller understanding of LINQ, but isn't required to use it.
