# Exercise

Congratulations! You have made it through all the background material. You now know enough to not only use LINQ, but to even reimplement some elements of it yourself! Doesn't that sound exciting?

Let's try it out!

## LINQ Select() method

One of the more commonly used methods in LINQ is the `Select()` method. `Select()` is an extension method to the `IEnumerable<T>` interface. It is analogous to the `map()` method found in many other programming languages.

`Select()` takes each element, one-at-a-time, from a source `IEnumerable<T>` sequence, applies a delegate function to the elements, and then returns an `IEnumerable<U>` result.

> **NOTE:** The type inside the collection can change, hence the change from `IEnumerable<T>` to `IEnumerable<U>`.

## Implement a Transform() method

In order to avoid the complications of dealing with generics in this exercise, let's limit the extension method to only work with `IEnumerable<int>`. Here is what you need to do:

 - Implement an extension to `IEnumerable<int>` called `Transform()`
 - The `Transform()` method should accept, as a parameter, a delegate that takes an `int` input and returns an `int` output
 - The `Transform()` method should be a generator that iterates through the input `IEnumerable<int>`, applies the delegate to each value, and `yield return`s the result
 - The `Transform()` should return an `IEnumerable<int>` output

## Here are some examples to help you out

### Example delegate declaration
```csharp
//// EMBED: LinqCourseEmbeddedCode/Delegates1.cs, Example delegate declaration
```

### Example extension method
```csharp
//// EMBED: LinqCourseEmbeddedCode/CoolExtensionsForInt2.cs, Example extension method with extra parameters
```

### Example generator
```csharp
//// EMBED: LinqCourseEmbeddedCode/IEnumerable1.cs, Declare GetDoubles() generator method
```
